# HR_Dashboard
Track key HR metrics, such as employee turnover, time to hire, and employee satisfaction. 
Identify trends in your HR data, such as changes in employee demographics, hiring rates, and turnover rates. 
Compare your HR data to industry benchmarks. Make informed HR decisions based on data-driven insights.

The dashboard could also include filters and slicers that allow you to drill down into your data and focus on specific areas of interest.
For example, you could filter the data by department to see employee turnover rates by department, or you could slice the data by month to see time to hire trends over time.
